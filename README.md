# pyramid_patterns
A collection of different Pyramid patterns in Java. 

## Pattern 1

The first pattern is the one from image above - this is a pyramid with numbers.
Each number is printed exactly the number of times it denotes - means 1 is printed once, 2 is printed twice, 3 is printed 
thrice and so on.

There is leading white space of `rows-i` where i is the number of rows - for e.g in first row there is 4 white spaces,
3 in second and so on.

There is a function created for creating the login for the pattern, which is common in all cases, and one function which only prints


## Pattern 2

The second pattern is the image above - this is a pyramid pattern where numbers keep increasing on each row.

There is leading white space of `rows-i` where i is the number of rows - for e.g in first row there is 7 white spaces,
6 in second and so on.

Now for the numbers, you can see the with each row the count of numbers are increasing - so we have the logic where 
this happens.


## Pattern 3

The third pattern is the one from image above - this is a pyramid with `*` instead of numbers.
Each `*` is printed exactly the number of times it denotes - means 1 is printed once, 2 is printed twice, 3 is printed
thrice and so on.

There is leading white space of `rows-i` where i is the number of rows - for e.g in first row there is 4 white spaces,
3 in second and so on.

The logic for printing `*` is same as pattern 1, in place of numbers, you print the character.


## Pattern 4

The fourth pattern is one from the image above - this is a pyramid where the numbers decrease up to mid and then increase
from the mid.



## Pattern 5

This is the inverted star pattern - just the opposite of the one from Pattern 3. 

The first row of the stars has the number that you enter for the rows - let it be `rows`. With each increasing row,
the number of the stars decrease by 2 and whitespace increase by 1.
